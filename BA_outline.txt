Outline


1. Introduction
1.1. Background
    Autonomous Driving:
        Briefly define autonomous driving and describe the different levels of autonomy (SAE Levels 0-5).
        Explain why real-time processing is critical for autonomous vehicles—tasks like sensor fusion, obstacle detection, and decision-making require high-speed, accurate processing to ensure safety and efficiency.
        
    The Role of GPUs in Autonomous Driving:
        Introduce GPUs as a solution to the high computational demands of autonomous driving. Emphasize how GPUs excel in parallel processing, making them ideal for handling large datasets and performing computations for tasks such as perception, path planning, and control.
        Mention existing solutions like NVIDIA’s Drive PX platform that utilize GPUs for accelerating deep learning algorithms in autonomous vehicles.

1.2. Motivation

    Performance Bottlenecks:
        Discuss how traditional CPU-based systems can struggle to handle the real-time demands of autonomous driving, particularly when processing large volumes of data from sensors.
        Introduce the potential of GPU coroutines to solve some of these performance bottlenecks by enabling more efficient parallel execution of asynchronous tasks.
    Need for Optimized Processing:
        Explain the motivation behind exploring GPU coroutines specifically: improving performance, reducing latency, and optimizing real-time decision-making.
        State the hypothesis or assumption that using GPU coroutines in an autonomous driving system will lead to better resource utilization and reduced latency, improving the vehicle’s overall performance.

1.3. Problem Statement

    Key Problem:
        Autonomous vehicles require real-time data processing for tasks like sensor fusion, object detection, and path planning. The computational demand for these tasks often results in performance issues, particularly with systems relying solely on CPUs or traditional GPU processing models.
        There is a gap in utilizing GPU coroutines to asynchronously handle parallel tasks in a real-time autonomous driving context, which could lead to improved efficiency and lower latency.

    Research Focus:
        The proposed thesis will explore how GPU coroutines can be leveraged to improve the real-time performance of autonomous driving systems by reducing computational bottlenecks and optimizing task scheduling on the GPU.
