\chapter{Persistent Threads}\label{chapter:Persistent Threads}

Persistent GPU threads allow the hardware resources to be partitioned and reduce kernel execution and scheduling overhead.  
While the persistent \acs{GPU} threads do not allow for asynchronous programming such as with coroutines, still help ensure runtime guarantees and support execution preemption.  
Furthermore, with the entire \acs{GPU} partitioned across persistent threads, the hardware resources can be manually assigned according to the \acs{SM} number. 

To implement these persistent \acs{GPU} threads, I sought to find an open source implementation; however, I only found the LightKer implementation, used to profile persistent threads. 
The LightKer implementation implemented Mailboxes to schedule
