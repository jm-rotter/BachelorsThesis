\chapter{Objectives}\label{chapter:Objectives}

The objective for this thesis is to develop, implement and evaluate a persistant thread with coroutine based scheduling approach for GPU threads in Apollo\footnote{Apollo is an open-source project developed by Baidu. For more information, visit the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo}}, an open source autonomous driving platform, to improve real-time safety and determinism by ensuring a predictable scheduling behavior. 
To adress the limitations of GPUs in real time systems, the new coroutine based scheduling mechanism LuisaCompute-coroutine\footnote{\cite{Zheng2022LuisaRender} and the accompanying source code \url{https://github.com/LuisaGroup/LuisaCompute-coroutine/tree/next}} will be integrated into Apollo. 
The Luisa coroutine scheduling was designed for graphics rendering tasks, around which their \acs{DSL} is written. 
Therefore, the scheduler and its \acs{DSL} will need to be adapted to fit the requirements of the autonomous driving domain, which prioritizes responsiveness, fault tolerance, and strict timing guarantees.  
By integrating this feature into Apollo, the GPU will be able to use coroutines for more flexible and efficient task management, ultimately enhancing the reliability and safety of the real-time autonomous driving platform.
