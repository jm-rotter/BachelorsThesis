\chapter{Persistent Threads}\label{chapter:Persistent Threads}

Persistent GPU threads allow the hardware resources to be partitioned and reduce kernel execution and scheduling overhead and are fundamental for other applications seeking to enhance GPU scheduling.  
While the persistent \acs{GPU} threads do not allow for asynchronous programming such as with coroutines, they still help to ensure runtime guarantees and support execution preemption.  
Running persistent threads additionally allows the memory to be loaded during during execution allowing greater parallelism and reduced 




To implement these persistent \acs{GPU} threads, I sought to find an open source implementation; however, I only found the LightKer implementation, used to profile persistent threads. 
The LightKer implementation implemented Mailboxes to schedule
