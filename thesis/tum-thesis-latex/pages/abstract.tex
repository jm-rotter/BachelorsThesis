This thesis implements a real time persistent GPU scheduler that can serve as a foundation for a future coroutine based scheduling implementation.
By keeping threads alive across kernel executions, this approach reduces scheduling overhead and allows tasks to be managed more efficiently and at a finer granularity on the GPU.
Initial experiments show that persistent threads are faster and more flexible than traditional kernel launches, making them a promising building block for future coroutine based programming in areas like autonomous driving.
These findings highlight how low level GPU scheduling strategies can have a significant impact on the performance and responsiveness of real time workloads.
