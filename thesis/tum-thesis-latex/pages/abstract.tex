This thesis implements a real-time persistent GPU scheduler that can serve as a foundation for a future coroutine and priority-based scheduling implementation.
By keeping threads alive across kernel executions, this approach reduces scheduling overhead and allows tasks to be managed more efficiently and at a finer granularity on the GPU.
Results indicate that these persistent threads are faster and more flexible than traditional kernel launches, making them a promising building block for future coroutine-based programming in areas such as autonomous driving.
These findings highlight the significant impact that low-level GPU scheduling strategies can have on the performance and responsiveness of real-time workloads.
