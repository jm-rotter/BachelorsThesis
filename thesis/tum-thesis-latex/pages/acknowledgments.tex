%TODO: Acknowledgments

I want to thank my advisor, Jiangfeng Gu, for overseeing this project and providing the resources that enabled me to explore a topic I am passionate about.
I am grateful for his comments and suggestions, which helped guide my research.
Furthermore, I am grateful to Michael Gerndt, the overseer of this project from his course in Advanced Computer Architecture, which first sparked my interest in GPUs and low-level architecture.
I have greatly benefited from the experience of working on this thesis and look forward to applying these learnings in future projects.
