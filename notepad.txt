Coroutine: 

	Functions can pause and resume execution at certain points

	Through the use of functions like yield() and suspend() a program can give
	the control back to the caller of the function. Threads have their own
	stack and are managed by the operating system, coroutines share a single
	thread and use manual context switch mechanisms.


	CPU coroutine Context: Need to save the Stack Pointer, Program Counter and Register
	Context is stored in a stack frame

	Make context sets up the stack and the context for such a context switch

	Within the stack, the function's local variables, return address and other execution states will be stored during execution. 


	Flow of coroutine: 
	 	-Start: Stack and Context are prepared
			(MakeContext)
		-Yielding: 
			When a coroutine is running, it may decide to yield execution, either 
			voluntarily or becuase it has been preempted by another coroutine. During a 
			yield the state of the coroutine is saved.

		-Resume: Saved context is restored 


	Coroutine Scheduler

	Resume method to resume exec of coroutine in ready state
	stop allows to stop coroutines exec


	context pool is a memory pool for routinecontext objects. The routinecontext
	is where the actual executoin state of the coroutine is stored

	Routinestate object (FINISHED READY RUNNING)


	SWAP Context
